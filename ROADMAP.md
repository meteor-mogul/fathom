# Roadmap
To do list and future plans for fathom

## Style

Bootstrap version looks a lot nicer.  Need to dive into Vuetify to figure out how its selects work.

## Conversions with offset

Energy and power conversions all assume same starting value.

But temperature conversions will require offset.

E.g., converting from celsius to fahrenheit requires 9/5 ratio plus offset of 32.

## More types

Here's what Google unit converter can do:

- Area
- Data Transfer Rate
- Digital Storage
- Energy
- Frequency
- Fuel Economy
- Length
- Mass
- Plane Angle
- Pressure
- Speed
- Temperature
- Time
- Volume
